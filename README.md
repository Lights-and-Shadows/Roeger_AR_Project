# StrangeAttractAR
 
Welcome to my AGGP 231 AR Project!

This is a simple application that showcases mathematical objects known as strange attractors. The complexity behind the math involved varies between each object, much like the objects themselves, as most things from chaos do. This app will be updated on a regular basis with additional objects to view, as well as quality of life improvements when it gets to that point. 

All of the formulas used in this application are derived from Juergen Meier's site over at http://www.3d-meier.de (NOTE: the site is in German, so for non-German speakers you will need Google Translate to fully understand the content)

A help panel has been provided in the application, which will cover the following:

------------ MECHANICS -------------------

The user will need to look around the room to find planes that appear in their environment. One can then place an object on said planes and move it around as the object animates itself over time (WARNING: this process will be extremely taxing on your system so if it crashes, don't be alarmed -- I will seek to address this issue at some point soon)

To circumvent this issue, I have provided buttons that directly interact with the AR session to pause, resume, and restart it as you see fit, in order to prevent overheating. There is also a button that stops and restarts the plane generation to further help with this.

To select different objects, simply press on the Prev and Next buttons in the middle of your screen. A panel on the bottom right corner will tell you which object you have currently selected.

If you have any issues or just general questions, feel free to place an issue request. 

Thank you for looking at the app!
